# wow-death-strike-analyzer
This program will take a log from Warcraftlogs and provide feedback of death strike usage in the form of graphs.  
This is built ontop of Ã‚ngryDK's work on getting death strike information extracted from logs.  
This requires a APIv1 key from https://www.warcraftlogs.com/profile and for it to be in a .env file.  
Analysis.py contains all the information extraction and frontend.py is the frontend.
